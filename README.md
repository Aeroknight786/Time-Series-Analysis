# Time-Series-Analysis
• Evaluated the performance of an equally weighted portfolio and generated a tear sheet containing metrics such as Rolling Sharpe, Sortino and Calmar ratios 
• Implemented Monte Carlo Simulations to forecast future performance using Cholesky Decomposition and generated Efficient Frontier for multiple assets 
• Employed SciPy’s SLSQP optimizer and cvxpy to run convex optimization on risk -adjusted return to generate Efficient Frontier with increased precision 
• Visualized frontiers after removing short-selling constraints and employing leverage in order to plot required allocation weights for desired risk-aversion levels
